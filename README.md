# Comparing-ML-Classification-Algorithms
The project aims to compare the performance of multiple machine learning classification algorithms on the Mushroom Classification Dataset. By implementing and evaluating various algorithms, the project seeks to identify the most effective model for accurately classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features.
